*Summary*

This dataset was acquired to demonstrate non-invasive measurements of regional oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) from quantitative BOLD MRI modeling at baseline and after pharmacological vasodilation. [1] We hypothesized that OEF decreases in response to vasodilation with acetazolamide (ACZ) in healthy conditions, reflecting compensation in regions with increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), while cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) remained unchanged. [2] We also aimed to assess the relationship between OEF and perfusion in the default mode network (DMN) regions that have shown associations with vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular reactivity in different neurological conditions.

*MRI data*

Images were acquired on a 3T scanner with a 32-channel head coil before and after administration of 15mg/kg ACZ as a pharmacological vasodilator. The MR imaging acquisition protocols included: (i) a Gradient Echo Slice Excitation Profile Imaging Asymmetric Spin Echo (GASE) scan to quantify OEF, deoxygenated blood volume (DBV), and reversible transverse relaxation rate (R2â€™) and (ii) a multi-post labeling delay arterial spin labeling (pcASL) scan to measure CBF. (iii) High-resolution T1 weighted anatomical images were also acquired to register and generate tissue-specific masks.
